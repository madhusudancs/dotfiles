;; ========== Line by line scrolling ==========

;; This makes the buffer scroll by only a single line when the up or
;; down cursor keys push the cursor (tool-bar-mode) outside the
;; buffer. The standard emacs behaviour is to reposition the cursor in
;; the center of the screen, but this can make the scrolling confusing

;; ===== Turn off tab character =====

;;
;; Emacs normally uses both tabs and spaces to indent lines. If you
;; prefer, all indentation can be made from spaces only. To request this,
;; set `indent-tabs-mode' to `nil'. This is a per-buffer variable;
;; altering the variable affects only the current buffer, but it can be
;; disabled for all buffers.

;;
;; Use (setq ...) to set value locally to a buffer
;; Use (setq-default ...) to set value globally

;; ===== Turn on Auto Fill mode automatically in all modes =====

;; Auto-fill-mode the the automatic wrapping of lines and insertion of
;; newlines when the cursor goes over the column limit.

;; This should actually turn on auto-fill-mode by default in all major
;; modes. The other way to do this is to turn on the fill for specific modes
;; via hooks.
